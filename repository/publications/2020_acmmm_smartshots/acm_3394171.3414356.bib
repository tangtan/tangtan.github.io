abstract = {Videos become prevalent for storytellers to inspire viewers' interests. To further enhance narrations, visualizations are integrated into videos to present data-driven insights. However, manually crafting such data-driven videos is difficult and time-consuming. Thus, we present SmartShots, a system that facilitates the automatic integration of in-video visualizations. Specifically, we propose a computational framework that integrates non-verbal video clips, images, a melody, and a data table to create a video with data visualizations embedded. The system automatically translates the multi-media material into shots and then combines the shots into a compelling video. In addition, we develop a set of post-editing interactions to incorporate users' design knowledge and help them re-edit the automatically-generated videos.},
