abstract = {Graph sampling, simplying the networks while preserving primary graph characteristics, provides a convenient means for exploring large network. During the last few years a variety of graph sampling algorithms have been proposed, and the evaluation and comparison of the algorithms has witnessed a growing interest. Although different tests have been conducted, an important aspect of graph sampling, namely, uncertainty in graph sampling, has been ignored so far. Additionally, existing studies mainly rely on simple statistical analysis and a few relatively small datasets. They may not be applicable to other more complicated graphs with much larger numbers of nodes and edges. Furthermore, while graph clustering is becoming increasingly important, it is still unknown how different sampling algorithms and their associated uncertainty can impact the subsequent graph analysis, such as graph clustering. In this work, we propose an efficient visual analytics framework for measuring the uncertainty from different graph sampling methods and quantifying the influence of the uncertainty in general graph analysis procedures. A spreadsheet-style visualization with rich user interactions is presented to facilitate visual comparison and analysis of multiple graph sampling algorithms. Our framework helps users gain a better understanding of the graph sampling methods in producing uncertainty information. The framework also makes it possible for users to quickly evaluate graph sampling algorithms and select the most appropriate one for their applications.}
